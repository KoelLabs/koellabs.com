00:00.000 --> 00:04.359
So, Phil recruited me to sell these cards, and now I am recruiting you.

00:05.064 --> 00:05.696
Who is this guy again?

00:06.060 --> 00:06.720
Don't worry about Phil.

00:06.884 --> 00:07.620
He drives a Corvette.

00:07.620 --> 00:08.475
He's doing just fine.

00:09.000 --> 00:09.086
Okay.

00:09.481 --> 00:12.415
Calling cards are the wave of the future.

00:13.702 --> 00:14.720
These things sell themselves.

00:14.740 --> 00:16.020
Who uses calling cards anyway?

00:16.122 --> 00:16.520
You know what?

00:16.926 --> 00:17.820
That's a nice attitude, Ryan.

00:18.344 --> 00:20.299
I'm just helping you invest in your future, my friend.

00:20.540 --> 00:21.858
It sounds like a get-rich-quick scheme.

00:22.040 --> 00:22.104
Yes!

00:22.421 --> 00:22.957
Thank you!

00:23.386 --> 00:24.220
You will get rich quick.

00:24.670 --> 00:24.998
We all will!

00:25.640 --> 00:27.860
Didn't you lose a lot of money on that other investment?

00:27.860 --> 00:28.715
That one from the email?

00:29.144 --> 00:29.534
You know what, Toby?

00:30.061 --> 00:34.900
When the son of the deposed king of Nigeria emails you directly asking for help, you help.

00:35.260 --> 00:37.680
His father ran the freaking country, okay?

00:39.121 --> 00:42.539
Alright, so raise your hand if you wanna get rich.

00:43.424 --> 00:43.958
Alright.

00:44.463 --> 00:46.558
No, um, how is this not a pyramid scheme?

00:47.180 --> 00:47.913
Alright, let me explain.

00:48.693 --> 00:48.900
Again.

00:52.143 --> 00:54.760
Phil has recruited me and another guy.

00:55.463 --> 00:57.960
We are getting three people each.

00:58.280 --> 01:02.700
The more people that get involved, the more people who are investing, the more money we're all gonna make.

01:03.200 --> 01:04.300
It's not a pyramid scheme.

01:04.682 --> 01:06.919
It is a, it's not even a scheme per se, it's...
